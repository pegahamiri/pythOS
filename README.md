# Pythos
Python Operator Splitting code

Operator-splitting (OS) methods are powerful and popular
  divide-and-conquer methods used to solve differential
  equations. Implementations of OS methods, however, are rarely
  performed in a general-purpose way.  We developed _Pythos_, a
  Python library designed to facilitate the systematic implementation,
  exploration, and evaluation of operator splitting methods. 
  _Pythos_ can be a general-purpose tool for researchers
  and practitioners for the time integration of differential equations
  using OS methods.
